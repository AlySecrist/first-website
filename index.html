                  <p>
                    My name is Aly (Alyssa) Secrist. My husband and I recently moved to the Mankato, Minnesota area to be closer to his kids, and I am a student of Software Engineering at Thinkful. Previously, I was a phlebotomist and machine technician for a plasma donation center, and as much as I enjoyed my job there, I am very much looking forward to my future as a Web Developer!

                <!--how got into coding-->
                  <p>
                    My desire to learn to code was born from a need to find a career that afforded me the opportunity to focus on my health. I have an autoimmune disorder that, in its most basic form, is a type of arthritis that primarily affects the lower back, but can also cause a host of other issues. Working an ever-changing schedule at a job that required me to be on my feet 8+ hours a day, 5 days a week, drastically exacerbated those struggles, leaving me in too much pain and too exhausted to dedicate any time to my health. So long story short, I talked with a friend who had taught herself coding during some health struggles of her own, she directed me to an open source program called <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="blank">The Odin Project</a>, I quickly fell in love with coding, found an online bootcamp called <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="blank">Thinkful</a> through the program, and this website is the result of my pre-course.

                  <!--why I love coding-->
                  <p>
                    I can already say that coding is incredibly frustrating, but I can also say that that is part of why I love it so much. I have always been the sort to enjoy problem solving and figuring out puzzles, so for me, software engineering and web development just fits. It is so incredibly satisfying to struggle with something and then suddenly, it all makes sense. I know I have a long journey ahead of me, and much more frustration and struggle to come, but I feel like I've finally figured out what I want to be when I grow up (and I'm 30)! I am so excited to see what the future holds and to meet and work with like-minded people who focus on solving things instead of the fact that they're broken in the first place.

                <p>
                  Outside of my newfound adoration of web development, I also enjoy listening to music (my husband is the vocalist in a metal band and also does a lot of mixing and mastering work), playing video games (diehard PlayStation fan), drinking tea, makeup, art, and caring for our *cough* 7 cats. Yes. <strong>Seven</strong>. We never <em>intended</em> to turn into crazy cat people...but here we are! I also very strongly identify with Abby from NCIS, just your friendly, super optimistic and bubbly, neighborhood weirdo!
